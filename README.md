**Measuring and Visualizing Healthcare Proces Variability**

Understanding factors that contribute to clinical variability in patient care is critical, as unwarranted variability can lead to increased adverse events and prolonged hospital stays. Determining when this variability becomes excessive can be a step in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.This study presents a standardized way to measure and visualize variability in clinical processes and measure its impact on patient-relevant outcomes.
