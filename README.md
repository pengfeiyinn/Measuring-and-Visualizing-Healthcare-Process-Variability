# Measuring and Visualizing Healthcare Process Variability

## Overview

Understanding factors that contribute to clinical variability in patient care is critical, as unwarranted variability can lead to increased adverse events and prolonged hospital stays. Determining when this variability becomes excessive can be a step in optimizing patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency. This study presents a standardized way to measure and visualize variability in clinical processes and measure its impact on patient-relevant outcomes.

## Dataset

This cohort study uses [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/), a dataset collecting electronic health records of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the United States. We focused on adult patients who underwent elective coronary bypass surgery, generating 847 patient observations. Demographics factors such as age, race, insurance type, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI) were recorded.
